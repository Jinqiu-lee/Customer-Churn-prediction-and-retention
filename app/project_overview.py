    Customer churn is when customers **leaves a business or stops using its services**, such as subscription-based company like :
    - Telecoms --- True,AIS Thailand,China Mobile,Verizon,Vodafone, 
    - Streaming Services --- Netflix, HBO Max,spotify, Tencent Video,iQIYI, 
    - SaaS platforms --- Alibaba Cloud,Salesforce,Microsoft365,Kahoot(Norway) 

    Churn means "Lost Revenue" and "Customer Lifetime Value"

    Acquiring new customers is 5x more expensive than keeping existing ones. Losing customers hurts revenue and growth.
    By predicting who is likely to leave, businesses can:
    - Target high-risk customers with personalized offers
    - **Improve customer satisfaction** by adressing pain points
    - **Save costs** and **increase revenues** by focusing retention efforts efficiently.

    **Dataset**:
    The dataset used comes from a real-world telecom company and includes:
    - Customer demographics (e.g., gender, dependant, tenure, contract type)
    - Services used (e.g., internet, phone, streaming)
    - Billing & payment behavior
    - Whether the customer churned

    **Limitations**:
    - No behavioral or customer feedback data (e.g., complaints, satisfaction scores)
    - Class imbalance (e.g., the churned customers 1 has much less than stayed customers 0)
    - Some features may be outdated or specific to one company""")
