    Acquiring new customers is 5x more expensive than keeping existing ones. Losing customers hurts revenue and growth.
    By predicting who is likely to leave, businesses can:
    - Target high-risk customers with personalized offers
    - **Improve customer satisfaction** by adressing pain points
    - **Save costs** and **increase revenues** by focusing retention efforts efficiently.
